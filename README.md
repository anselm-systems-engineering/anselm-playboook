## What is ANSELM?

ANSELM is a systems engineering approach that puts **knowledge before artifacts** and treats **AI as an intellectual partner**, not just a tool.

Core principles:

- 🧠 **Knowledge-First** — Build understanding before diagrams
- 🤖 **AI as Co-Pilot** — Partner with AI for reasoning, not just generation
- 🔄 **Disposable Views** — Diagrams are outputs, not sources of truth
- ✅ **Continuous Coherence** — Validate consistency at every step
- 📄 **Open Ecosystem** — Plain text (Markdown) over proprietary tools

→ Read the full manifesto at [anselm.ing](https://anselm.ing)

## What is this Repository?

This repo provides the **practical implementation** of ANSELM principles:

| Manifesto (anselm.ing) | Playbook (this repo) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| *Why* — Philosophy | *How* — Practices |
| Principles | Patterns |
| Inspiration | Templates |
| Timeless | Versioned |

## Quick Start

### 1. Read the Playbook

Start with [playbook/ANSELM-Playbook.md](playbook/ANSELM-Playbook.md) — a complete operational guide including:

- 30-minute quick start
- Four-phase workflow
- Prompting patterns
- Troubleshooting

### 2. Use Templates

Copy templates from [playbook/templates/](playbook/templates/) to your project:

- `knowledge-cell.md` — Capture any knowledge
- `decision-record.md` — Document decisions (ADR-style)
- `session-log.md` — Track AI collaboration sessions
- `project-canvas.md` — One-page project overview
- `context-transfer.md` — Hand off between sessions/people

### 3. Learn from Case Studies

Review [case-studies/](case-studies/) for real-world ANSELM applications. Each case study includes:

- Context and constraints
- How ANSELM was applied
- Lessons learned
- Knowledge Cells produced

---

## Case Studies

| Case Study | Domain | AI Model | Key Insight |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| [Regulatory DMS](case-studies/regulatory-dms/) | Public Sector | Claude | First ANSELM case study, co-authored with AI |

*Want to add your case study? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)*

## The AI Perspective

This repository includes something unique: **Knowledge Cells written by an AI** reflecting on its experience as an ANSELM co-pilot.

> "ANSELM is the first manifesto that takes AI seriously as a participant in the systems process. But the manifesto writes about AI in third person. Maybe it's worth asking AI how it feels as a co-pilot?"
>
> — From [AI Perspective](case-studies/regulatory-dms/knowledge-cells/ai-perspective.md)

We believe this meta-reflection adds unique value to the methodology discussion.
