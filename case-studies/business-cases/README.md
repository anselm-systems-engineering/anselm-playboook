# ANSELM Business Cases

Real-world success stories demonstrating ANSELM methodology effectiveness.

## What's Here

Business cases are **anonymized success references** — they describe outcomes and approach without revealing proprietary details or internal Knowledge Cells.

Unlike full case studies (which include complete KC sets), business cases focus on:

- Problem context and complexity
- Approach taken
- Measurable outcomes
- Lessons learned

## Available Business Cases

## Business Cases vs Case Studies

| Aspect | Business Case | Case Study |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| **Content** | Outcomes and approach | Full Knowledge Cells |
| **Detail level** | Executive summary | Working artifacts |
| **Purpose** | Demonstrate value | Teach methodology |
| **Sensitivity** | Safe for public sharing | May require anonymization |
| **Audience** | Decision makers | Practitioners |

Both types are valuable — business cases build confidence, case studies build competence.
